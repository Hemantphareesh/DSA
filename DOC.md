# Data Structure and Algorithms

## Big O

Log n => something which is successively divided untill it reaches one that is represented as log.
Eg: i=n;i>1;i=i/2

## Recursion
Function calling itself with base condition which will terminate the function.
recursion have calling phase and returning phase.

```
func(n)
{
    calling   -> Ascending
    func(n-1)  * 2 where 2 will be returning 
    Returning  -> Descending
}
```


## Formulas:

1. 1+2+3+.....+n-3+n-2+n-1 = n(n-1)/2 = (n^2 - n) / 2 => O(n^2) 
uses concept called Degree of a Polynomial (The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable (like x, y, etc.) that has a non-zero coefficient.).



## Notes:

1. To Compile C and C++
```
gcc sum_array.c -o sum_array
g++ sum_array.cpp -o sum_array
```

## Pattern Found

Learn swap in array and swift array elements right to left or left to right.
